1.	Draft a well-formed problem statement relevant to a business problem affecting your team, division, or organization.

A tech-driven staffing company connects part-time hourly workers to real-time opportunities via a marketplace app. As a way to grow the worker pool and engender worker loyalty to the app, the company is looking to understand for what skills they could provide training to the workers to help them get higher paid jobs.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has a wealth of data around SOC (standard occupational codes), such as avg salary, # of people, skills needed, capabilities needed, industries relevant, etc.

We can use this data to understand what skills are correlated most with the next level of higher incomes and target jobs.

2.	Include the following elements:
o	Hypothesis/assumptions

Assumptions: There will be a handful of skills that are correlated with various income buckets. There will also be a lot of skills that are correlated with a very wide range of jobs and income buckets. 

Hypothesis: Of the skills that ARE correlated well with certain income buckets, some of these will not be addressable through standard trainings. But some of them will be. These are the skills the company can target.

o	Goals and success metrics

Does the model predict predict income range for a certain skill OR combination of skills, based on the training data, with a 90% degree of confidence?

o	Risks or limitations

Cross over between skills may make it hard to isolate one or even two combined skills that predict income. It might be combination of 10 or more skills. 

Other factors besides skills drive income. 

None of the skills that drive income are trainable. 

Maybe capabiliites are more correlated to income than skills - I can always pivot and explore this analysis as a backup. 

3.	Identify at least one relevant internal dataset and confirm that you have (or can get) the right access permissions.

It is all publically available governments data. I have identified 3 data sets that I will need to combine/ connnect to run analsysis. One has all the SOC codes mapped to income. One has SOC codes mapped to skills and once has SOC codes mapped to capabilities and job name.
